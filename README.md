A splash screen will go to sign in if before there is no user login else it will go to the profile of the user.
A login: login, register and reset the password.
Register: collect the data from the user then push that information on Firebase (Cloud Firestore) and Authentication (Firebabse).
        : these databases are connected by the userID (which is auto generated by Firebase).
        
Edit Profile: for user to update their information (such as shipping address, avatar).

All function is working but there is no input validation (do later)
